## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

* Search for weather information by entering a location
* View current weather details such as temperature, condition icon, and location
* See additional metrics including feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
* Browse a 7-day daily forecast with high/low temperatures
* View an hourly forecast for selected days
* Switch between days in the hourly forecast
* Toggle between Metric and Imperial units (temperature, wind speed, precipitation)
* Experience an optimal layout across mobile and desktop devices
* See hover and focus states for interactive elements
